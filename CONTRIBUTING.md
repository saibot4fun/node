# Contributing to Hammer

Hi! Thank you for your interest in contributing to Hammer, we really appreciate it.

There are many ways to contribute – reporting bugs, feature suggestions, fixing bugs, submitting pull requests for enhancements.

## Reporting Bugs, Asking Questions, Sending Suggestions

Just [file a GitHub issue](https://github.com/jkup/hammer/issues/new), that’s all. If you want to prefix the title with a “Question:”, “Bug:”, or the general area of the application, that would be helpful, but by no means mandatory. If you have write access, add the appropriate labels.

If you’re filing a bug, specific steps to reproduce are helpful. Please include the URL of the page that has the bug, along with what you expected to see and what happened instead.

Here is a [handy link for submitting a new bug](https://github.com/jkup/hammer/issues/new?body=URL%3A%0A%0AWhat+I+expected%3A%0A%0ASteps+to+reproduce%3A%0A%0AWhat+happened+instead%3A&title=Description%20of%20the%20problem).
